# MVC

## Definition

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern in software architecture where the software is divided into three central components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.
The View usually refers to any interfaces through which the user interacts with the program and the graphical representation of the program.
The Model primarily serves to structure and store the data that the program processes.
The Controller manages the entire application and processes the data coming from users or other sources like sensors or APIs.
This architecture allows for a flexible design with high reusability of the individual modules.

## Additional Information

- For a small application, using an MVC architecture can create a very high effort and is not always practical
- MVC allows for very easy extension of a program due to its high modularity and low dependency between modules
- In ASP.NET, MVC often uses Dependency Injection to follow SOLID principles and better separate the responsibilities of the modules
