# SOLID

## Definition

#### General

SOLID is an acronym for a collection of 5 principles by Robert C. Martin that form the foundation for modern software architecture in object-oriented programming.

The 5 principles are as follows:
- Single Responsibility Principle (1):
  - There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
- Open-Closed Principle (2):
  - Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (3):
  - If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle (4):
  - Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (5):
  - Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

The main goal of these 5 principles is to make object-oriented code more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## Additional Information

Since the establishment of the SOLID principles, the software industry has evolved significantly, and many of the languages used today cannot implement the original principles exactly.
As a result, more modern definitions for the 5 principles have been developed to cover functional programming and other approaches.

These newer definitions are:
- (1) Each module should do one thing and do it well.
- (2) You should be able to use and add to a module without rewriting it.
- (3) You should be able to substitute one thing for another if those things are declared to behave the same way.
- (4) Donâ€™t show your clients more than they need to see.
- (5) Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
